Great recipe! Yes the annatto and garlic are listed twice because they are used twice...SMH. McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido) so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores. The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor. This one's a keeper!

I am making this recipe for the second time. It's great! Since annatto is a coloring (and I couldn't find it) I substituted a little turmeric. Last time I made it with chicken this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet with the vinegar it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again delicious.

This is my second time making it. The first time I didn't have annatto powder so I subbed for sweet blend tumeric (it has lots of cinnamon in it which added a special magic to the flavor and not to mention it made it smell even better if you can believe that) and paprika. This time around I found annatto powder and I still added the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you.:)

best and most authentic adobo i have made. the first time I had to use turmeric (no annatto available) and palm vinager (no coconut vinegar available) and it came out really nicely. the turmeric imparted a noticeable ginger flavor but it was subtle. The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I marinate my chicken over night and up to 24 hours and i use air chilled chicken - it sucks up all the marinade so I use only 4 LBs chicken and that seems to work fairly well giving enough gravy to fully cover the rice. I also only use thighs and legs...lots of collagen and it gives the gravy an incredible sily mouth feel. Leftovers were even better than when it was first cooked. SO GOOD!!!

Instructions Checklist
Step 1

In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the soy sauce, oil, honey, ginger root, and garlic. Heat in microwave on medium for 1 minute, then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds, watching closely to prevent boiling.

Step 2

Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over, and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.

Step 3

Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Drain marinade from chicken into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Set aside for basting.

Step 4

Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook chicken on the prepared grill 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. Baste frequently with remaining marinade. Chicken will turn a beautiful golden brown.

This is an excellent marinade. I omitted all the directions...instead I mixed up the ingredients and put them in a large plastic bag..didn't cook ingredients first. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours. Then I baked it in a 425 oven for 45 minutes in the marinade (per another reviewer)...I didn't bother to baste it...it turns a beautiful golden brown. I removed the ginger before baking. Also instead of crushing the garlic I diced it up really small...yum! One thing I will do next time is put foil in the pan that I'm baking in...makes cleanup much easier. This is very moist and tender.

This recipe was alright but lacked the true bento flavor I was after. I made a few changes: doubled the marinade marinaded overnight and cooked on the stove top. I also recommend using sodium reduced soy sauce as it was very salty. I will not be making this again.

I give this one 5 stars. I thought it was a very easy recipe and resulted in an excellent asian grilled chicken. Reminded me of an Japanese restaraunt I used to go to in downtown LA. I made everything per the recipe except I doubled the marinade. This left me plenty for basting and drizzling. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on the sliced chicken. I served over Jasmine rice. Highly recommended.

Wow. That's all I can say. I followed the recipe exactly except that I ended up adding green onions to the chicken. I cooked it in a skillet with a tbsp of oil over high heat. It is sooo good and even with the soy sauce it's not really all that salty. I served it with jasmine rice and some Wendjoe chilli pasta (hot chile sauce). Next time I'll steam some broccoli to go with it. So awesome.

The whole family loved it.. and I mean the WHOLE family all 9 of us! So far this has been the summer grilling favorite! The longer you marinate the better it taste! I definatly recommend pounding the chicken and not grilling for more than 10min very moist!! If you have leftovers there great chopped up in a salad! Thanks Janet!!

This had a subtle nicely balanced flavor but only after I fiddled with the marinade a bit. First I used about half the amount of soy sauce called for. I know how it can permeate delicately flavored chicken and it could potentially have made it too salty as well. Half the amount was the right amount. Second the type of sesame oil was not specified and it should be. Does the submitter intend the light cold-pressed sesame oil used for salads and for frying? Or did she intend the boldly flavored toasted" sesame oil used for flavor usually not more than a dribble in ANY dish? I just used my own judgment using the light sesame oil for the most part and just a little of the rich brown toasted sesame oil for its wonderful flavor. Ginger root is not something I use often so I rarely buy it (and I'm not terribly fond of it anyway). A light pinch of ground ginger sufficed. The honey was a nice addition giving the chicken a beautiful glazed appearance once it came off the grill. The chicken was tender and moist but I credit Hubs' expertise with grilling for that! Served with Classic Fried Rice and Easy Bok Choy this was a delicious darned near memorable meal and beautiful in its presentation. (Note: I didn't see heating the marinade ingredients as necessary so I didn't bother with that step. I just used the easier more common method of just dumping everything into a Ziploc bag. I marinated the chicken as the submitter recommended about 15 minutes)

Please follow the recipe to the T the first time you make it. I really hate when people rate recipes that they have changed in any way. I loved the recipe!! The only change I made was letting the chicken sit in the marinade a bit longer.

McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido) so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores. The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor. This one's a keeper!",

Last time I made it with chicken this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet with the vinegar it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again delicious.",

The first time I didn't have annatto powder so I subbed for sweet blend tumeric (it has lots of cinnamon in it which added a special magic to the flavor and not to mention it made it smell even better if you can believe that) and paprika. This time around I found annatto powder and I still added the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you.:)",

The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I marinate my chicken over night and up to 24 hours and i use air chilled chicken - it sucks up all the marinade so I use only 4 LBs chicken and that seems to work fairly well giving enough gravy to fully cover the rice. I also only use thighs and legs...lots of collagen and it gives the gravy an incredible sily mouth feel. Leftovers were even better than when it was first cooked. SO GOOD!!!",
