McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido) so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores. The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor. This one's a keeper!",

Last time I made it with chicken this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet with the vinegar it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again delicious.",

The first time I didn't have annatto powder so I subbed for sweet blend tumeric (it has lots of cinnamon in it which added a special magic to the flavor and not to mention it made it smell even better if you can believe that) and paprika. This time around I found annatto powder and I still added the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you.:)",

The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I marinate my chicken over night and up to 24 hours and i use air chilled chicken - it sucks up all the marinade so I use only 4 LBs chicken and that seems to work fairly well giving enough gravy to fully cover the rice. I also only use thighs and legs...lots of collagen and it gives the gravy an incredible sily mouth feel. Leftovers were even better than when it was first cooked. SO GOOD!!!",
